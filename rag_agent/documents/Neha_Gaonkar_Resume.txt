WORK EXPERIENCE
Data Scientist - AI Model Training | Outlier.ai | November 2023 – February 2025 | Remote
•
Worked on 4+ LLMs that are aligned for data science applications, assessing code generation, statistical models, and
analytical responses for correctness, maintainability, and alignment with industry standards.
•
Conducted RLHF-based model assessments, benchmarking and evaluating chatbot responses to enhance alignment with
real-world data science applications with unseen data in simulated workflows.
•
Contributed to the design and refinement of tools, agents, tool-calling logic, and structured JSON output alignment to
reduce hallucinations and improve performance.
•
Designed and executed over 50 end-to-end data science workflows to serve as reference outputs for RLHF, providing
targeted feedback to guide model alignment and improved domain-specific accuracy.
Data Analyst | Infosys | January 2021 - August 2022 | Pune, India
•
Analysed datasets weekly using advanced statistics, boosting operational efficiency by 10% and guiding strategic decisions.
•
Built data extraction and transformation pipelines, cutting financial reporting times by 5%.
•
Developed PowerBI dashboards to enhance visualisation and quicken decision-making by reducing latency by 15%.

EDUCATION
MSc in Computer Science (AI specialisation) | University of Nottingham | 2022 – 2023
•

Modules: Data Science with Machine Learning, Big Data and Technologies, Applied Statistics and Probability, Research Methods

CERTIFICATIONS
• Oracle Cloud Infrastructure 2024 Generative AI (LLM) Certified Professional – June 2024

PROJECTS
GPT from scratch (Andrej Karpathy’s GPT architecture)
•
•
•

Developed a 38M parameters character-level GPT Large Language Model (LLM) from scratch based on the GPT architecture by
Andrej Karpathy, implementing foundational principles of text generation and deep learning.
Creating training and validation datasets to prevent overfitting and ensure generalisability and implementing the model using
PyTorch with GPU acceleration. Building embeddings and utilising SoftMax and matrix operations to optimise predictions.
Trained the 38M model for 20000 epochs to generate text resembling a 48GB of text dataset (e.g., OpenWebText dataset) using
backpropagation and gradient descent.

Sentiment Analysis on Tweets for Financial Markets
•
Performed sentiment analysis on 943,672 tweets tagged #SPX500, leveraging multiple machine learning models—Linear
Regression, Random Forest, ARIMA, CNN, and SVR—to predict stock market movements.
•
Achieved an R² score of 0.9345 with Linear Regression, demonstrating a strong predictive relationship between social
sentiment and stock price fluctuations.
•
Conducted time-series correlation analysis by comparing aggregated sentiment scores with historical stock price
movements, uncovering a statistically significant correlation between sentiment polarity shifts and stock performance.
•
Integrated time-series forecasting and predictive modeling to quantify the impact of social sentiment on market behavior,
providing actionable insights for financial decision-making.
Mitigating Hallucinations and Improving Context-Awareness using Agentic-RAG
•
Designed an agentic multi-source RAG system that routes questions to Wikipedia, arXiv, and a private FAISS-indexed
corpus of crawled web pages.
•
Built the ingestion and indexing pipeline using WebBaseLoader for crawling the page, a text splitter for chunking, OpenAI
embeddings, and a FAISS vector store.
•
Implemented a LangChain Tools Agent with OpenAI function calling; the model selects tools and synthesises grounded
answers and used an OpenAI chat model configured with temperature zero to produce deterministic, context-aware
responses while reducing hallucinations.
•
Implemented LLM-as-a-judge to improve factuality, completeness and accuracy and evaluate the responses.
